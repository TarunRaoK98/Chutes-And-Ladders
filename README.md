# Chutes-And-Ladders
This project deals with designing algorithms that can be employed to calculate possible sequences of dice rolls for three cases.
case 1 : shortest number of steps to reach the last cell.
case 2 : reaching the last cell, by avoiding all Chutes.
case 3 : reachong the last cell, by avoiding all Chutes and Ladders.
